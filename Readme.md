Pigeons Readme
==============

A proof of the [pigeonhole principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pigeonhole_principle). This principle asserts that
if you put n things into m containers, and n > m, then at least
one of the containers contains more than one thing. I submitted
this proof as part of my application to SiFive.
